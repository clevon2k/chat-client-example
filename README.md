# About

This chat demo client is designed to be used with an 
[Overworld](https://github.com/saltysystems/overworld) 
game server, specifically the Quickstart Guide found 
[here](https://github.com/saltysystems/overworld/blob/master/doc/quickstart/intro.md).

# Getting Started
First, you should read the Overworld quickstart per above.
This demo has been tested with Godot 4.2 but should work with any 4.x version. You 
may get a mismatched version warning when importing, it should be safe to click through.

The demo has been tested against the `october-24` tag of the Overworld game server 
with Erlang/OTP 27. Other versions may not work.
